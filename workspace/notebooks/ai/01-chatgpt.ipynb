       "- **Definition**: Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is for the model to learn to predict the output labels for new, unseen data.\n",
       "- **Examples**: Common tasks include classification (e.g., spam detection in emails, image recognition) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices).\n",
       "- **Process**: The algorithm learns from the training data by minimizing the error in predictions through techniques like backpropagation (in neural networks) or minimizing a loss function.\n",

       "### Unsupervised Learning\n",
       "- **Definition**: Unsupervised learning deals with datasets that do not have labeled responses. The goal is to infer the natural structure present within a set of data points.\n",
       "- **Examples**: Common tasks include clustering (e.g., customer segmentation), association (e.g., market basket analysis), and dimensionality reduction (e.g., Principal Component Analysis).\n",
       "- **Process**: The algorithm tries to learn the patterns and the structure from the input data without references to known or labeled outcomes.\n",
       "- **Datasets**: Works with unlabeled data where the model identifies patterns based solely on the structure of the data itself.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Differences:\n",
       "- **Objective**: Supervised learning aims to predict an output given an input, while unsupervised learning aims to find patterns or intrinsic structures in input data.\n",
       "- **Data Requirement**: Supervised learning requires labeled data, whereas unsupervised learning does not.\n",
