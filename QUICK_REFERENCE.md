**Q: How long does deployment take?**
A: ~1-2 minutes (lint jobs + deployment).

## 🚨 Emergency Rollback

If something goes wrong after deployment:

```powershell
# SSH to Windows server
cd D:\apps\MaxLab

# See recent versions
git log --oneline -n 10

# Go back to previous version
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>

# Restart if needed
./start.ps1
```
